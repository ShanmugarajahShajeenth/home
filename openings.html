					<h2>Italian Game</h2>
					<p>
						The Italian Game is a white-side opening, and is a really old opening.
						It starts with moving the king's pawn forward two squares, then black moves their pawn forward two squares, you move your king side knight forward to attack black's pawn, black moves their knight to defend their pawn, and you take out your bishop to attack black's king.
						The good thing about this opening is that it attacks black's vulnerable pawn, which is close to the king.

					<h2>French Defense</h2>
					<p>
						This opening starts with you moving your king's pawn forward two squares, black moving their king's pawn one square, you moving your queen's pawn up two squares, and black doing the same, and after you move your king's pawn forward one square.
						This opening good, because it gives you good control over the structure and you can easily break black's pawn structure.

					<h2>Sicilian Defense</h2>
					<p>
						The opening starts with white moving their king's pawn forward two squares, and then you moving the pawn right to your queen's pawn up two squares.
						This gives you an advantage, since it gives you control on the center, by stopping white's queen's pawn from advancing.

					<h2>Caro-Kann Opening</h2>
					<p>
						The opening starts with white moving their king's pawn forward, and then you moving the pawn right to your queen's pawn forward one square.
