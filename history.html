			<h1>The History of Chess</h1>
			<h2>Ancient Relations</h2>
			<p>

				Possible origins can be from Russia, India, Central Asia, or Pakistan, since variants of chess has been found in these places.
				An example of one of these variants are chaturanga, a two player board game popular in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and parts of Central Asia.
			</p>
			<p>
				Chaturanga is considered the earliest predecesor of chess, since different pieces could move in different ways and victory was based on one piece, like the king in modern chess.
				It gradually evolved made its way to different places.
				It was carried by Silk Road Traders and Buddhist Pilgrims to the East.
				It reached China at 750 CE, and eventualy lead to the creation of Chinese Chess.
			</p>
			<h2>Chess Reaches Europe</h2>
			<p>
				A version of chaturanga, made its way through Perisia,and made it to Europe. 
				The Muslims brought chess to Sicily, Italy, and North Africa, the Eastern Slavs spread it in Kievan Rus, and the Vikings brought it all the way to England and Iceland.
			</p>
			<p>
				Chess was once banned from nations by kings and religious leaders.

				This game was also a favorite of many historical characters.
			</p>
			<h2>The Development of Chess</h2>
			<p>
				The development of chess was rather slow, because of the widespread variations.
				There were many major rules that were developed like how the pawns move and how the bishop moves in the 1400s.
				Another rule that was developed was pawn promotion.
				However, when this rule was developed, you could only promote a pawn to a bishop, when the pawn reaches the 8th rank.
				But today, you can promote a pawn to a queen, rook, knight, or a bishop.
			</p>
			<p>
				Chess was later developed into a game where you can deliver a checkmate in just 2 moves, and this is currently known as the Fool's Mate.
				Some rules were developed later in the 1600s like castling or en passants.
			</p>
			<h2>The World Championships</h2>
			<p>
				The title of World Champion was fought for in 2 player matches, and which started as an unofficial title in 1886.
				But chess gained a lot of interest 50 years later.
				The first international event was in 1834, which had 6 matches against British and Frech Players.
				In this event Louis-Charles de la Bourdonnais won, and gained the title.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, Bourdonnais died in 1840, and Staunton became the next unofficial world champion.
				He used his title to promote a set of rules and the first international tournament.
				This tournament was called the London Tournament, and it inspired the first national championship in America, the First American Chess Congress.
			</p>
			<h2>Creation of FIDE</h2>
			<p>
				Representatives of 15 countries came to meet in Paris in 1924 to creat the first international chess federation called FIDE.

			</p>
